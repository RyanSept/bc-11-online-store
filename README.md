# Agora (bc-11-online-store)

## Introduction
Agora is a Flask based online store platform. It allow users to create online stores. Each store has a shareable url and so does every product  eg. http://agora-store.herokuapp.com/not-nakumatt/mac-book-air . When a user accesses your store, they are able to see products you have added. To add products, you need an agora account. Once you have added this, you can create a store adding its name, description and address. Upon doing this you can add a product item to the store along with its description, image and price. Agora also offers you and your customers a clean and easy to use interface.
